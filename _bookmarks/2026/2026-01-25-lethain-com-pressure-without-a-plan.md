> I think the origin of this pattern is the misapplication of management by objectives. The theory of management by objectives is that the executing team is involved in both defining the goal and the implementation. That sounds good, almost what Escaping the Build Trap recommends. However, in practice it’s very common to see executives set targets, and then manage a low-agency team to hit those goals which the team believes are impossible, which leads very precisely to the “pressure without a plan” pattern.
