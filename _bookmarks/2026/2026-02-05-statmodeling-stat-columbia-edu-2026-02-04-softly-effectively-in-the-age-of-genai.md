> On some level language has always been a trap, even in its purest forms. We can tell ourselves that unlike the agents, we are not merely drifting about the boundaries of some innate blueprint as we communicate, that our speech is authentic because it’s the product of our lived experiences. But do we believe it? Can we distinguish our ability to be honest with ourselves from learned patterns of speech? I’ve always believed writing is essential to figuring out what one thinks, but falling into tropes is a constant risk. To what extent are our words just further confirmation of our own preconditioning? The agents may perform vulnerability without memory, but we can be very good at performing memory without vulnerability.
