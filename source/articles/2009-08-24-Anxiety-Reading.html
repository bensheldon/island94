Fiction writer Dawes Green was on <a href="http://http://www.studio360.org/episodes/2009/08/21">Studio360 on Saturday night</a> and he made mention  of how people have changed since he last published a novel 14 years ago: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong></strong> <em></em> </span>
<blockquote>People aren’t reading books so much. They text and Twitter and Google a lot—anxiety reading—but they’re too jumpy for books.</blockquote>
(I slightly lie: that quote above is from a <em>Publishers Weekly</em> interview, via <a href="http://litlicense.blogspot.com/2009/07/anxiety-reading.html">Literary License blog</a>, but it was close enough to what he said on the radio)
