From the <a href="http://www.jfklibrary.org/">John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum</a>:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OPERATION HIGH HOPES</span>
Explanation and Instruction Sheet</p>

RECORDS of the Official Campaign Song HIGH HOPES and ALL THE WAY (sample enclosed)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">PT BOAT PINS - the Campaign Emblem in 3 different styles</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Lapel Pins for Men   )

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOW OPERATION HIGH HOPES WORKS</span>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In return for giving $1 to the Kennedy Campaign Fund, a supporter is to receive, as a token of appreciation, EITHER a RECORD containing HIGH HOPES and ALL THE WAY OR a PT PIN in the style of his choice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In return for giving $2 to the Kennedy Campaign Fund, a supporter is to receive BOTH a RECORD and a PT PIN.</p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHAT CLUBS SHOULD DO</span>

1. Appoint a Chairman for RECORDS and PT PINS.

2. Decide on the number of RECORDS and PT PINS (minimum order of 25 of each) you think club members can distribute.

3. Return enclosed ORDER BLANK to National Headquarters. Do not collect money until you receive RECORDS and PINS from this office.

4. You will receive CONTRIBUTION ORDER PADS (samples enclosed) with your order. When a person gives $1 the appropirate slip is to be filled out in duplicate. One copy is to go to the contributor; other is to be sent here.

5. At the end of ever two week period, slips must be sent back to OEPRATON HIGH HOPES, National Headquarters, 261 Constitution Avenue, N. W., Washington, D. C.

6. Slips must be accompanied with a check or money order (no cash) covering correct amount (50 slips and $50). Checks should be made out to Washington D. C. KENNEDY FOR PRESIDENT COMMITTEE.

7. If a supporter wants to give more than $1 or $2 have him make out a check to Washington D. C. KENNEDY FOR PRESIDENT COMMITTEE, and send it to this address.</blockquote>
