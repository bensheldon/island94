I am very impressed with how Marcus du Sautoy's <em>The Number Mysteries</em> integrates hyperlinks into the book using URL shorteners and QR codes (above). Contrast that with Dan Cederholm's <em>Handcrafted CSS </em>(which is still an excellent book)<em>. </em>The latter was published August 2009, the former August 2010.
