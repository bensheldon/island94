Erin McKean makes the point in a <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/erin_mckean_redefines_the_dictionary.html">TED talk</a> that, unlike paper dictionaries, online dictionary searches do not provide serendipity: finding something you didn't know you were looking for.

I take this many ways:
True, but...
How many people regularly flip a dictionary?
How exact is search?
How many people just type the word into Google (which, because internet search sucks, is quite serendipitous).
