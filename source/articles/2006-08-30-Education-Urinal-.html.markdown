One should never be too surprised by what they might find in a restroom.  I was <em>impressed</em> though with what I learned from a sign hanging above a urinal at the National Zoo in Washington, DC.
<strong>"Spray it, don't say it!</strong>

<strong><em>Urine spraying is ok--if you're a lobster that is</em></strong>

Lobsters don't speak, but they do greet--by spraying urine at each other.  That's one one way they communicate..."

There was another person in the restroom washing his hands when I took the picture; I calmly allayed any fears he may have had by telling him, "It's okay, I'm a photographer."
