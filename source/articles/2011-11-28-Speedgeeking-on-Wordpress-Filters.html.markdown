Tonight I'll be making 10 five-minute presentations about Wordpress Filters, centered on this post about [adding class to Wordpress linked images](http://www.island94.org/2011/01/adding-class-to-wordpress-linked-images/), at the [ San Francisco Wordpress Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/wordpress-sf/events/40941622/). The presentation is available for [download as a PDF](http://www.island94.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Wordpress-Filters-Speedgeeking-Ben-Sheldon.pdf).
