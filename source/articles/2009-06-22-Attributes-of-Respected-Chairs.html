I found the following on the photocopier (after a few days, I assume its orphaned). Sourced from a SurveyMonkey print-out, it's part of a "BYU Chair Study" which through context I assume is polling what training resources the owner of this printout requires.

These are attributes of Respected Chairs. The context is a faculty member within an academic institution, but it's pretty easy to convert to other contexts. As always, the gems beneath the headings (for example, anything that recognizes the time and place for procrastination has my vote).
<blockquote><strong>Be healthy and well-balanced</strong> (take care of yourself and your other life): Family, friends, community, religion, teaching &amp; research, health and emotional needs

<strong>Be competent</strong>: Key leadership skills, preparation, participation, people, issues, professional &amp; national trends
