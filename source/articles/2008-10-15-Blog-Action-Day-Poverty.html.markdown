<p>Today is <a href="http://blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day</a> and this year's topic is <strong>Poverty</strong>.  Since I've <a href="http://island94.org/tags/poverty">recently written</a> about poverty directly, today I'll be more lateral:</p>
<h3>Today I am wearing:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cotton American Apparel T-Shirt (with print-design from Woot!)</li>
<li>Denim Banana Republic Jeans</li>
<li>Saucony Synthetic Running Shoes</li>
<li>Old Navy Underwear</li>
<li>Hanes Cotton Socks</li>
<li>Leather Belt purchased from Brooklyn St. Fair with Levi's Metal Belt Buckle</li>
<li>Penguin Lambswool Sweater</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Discussion Set 1</strong>: What types of information have I included in this list?  What have I omitted? What types of information would you have included (or omitted)? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Discussion Set 2</strong>: In my clothing, what could I have done differently, within the broad context of <em>poverty</em>? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Discussion Set 3</strong>: How have you approached this exercise: Realistically, Positively, Pessimistically, Cynically, Pragmatically, Comprehensively, Reductionistically, etc?  How did the context or presentation of this exercise affect how you did (or did not) perform it? How might someone else approach this exercise and why?</p>

<p><strong>Discussion Set 4</strong>: Is this an appropriate exercise for addressing poverty?</p>
