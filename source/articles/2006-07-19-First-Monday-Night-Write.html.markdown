Monday was Saul and my's first Monday Night Write (MNW); a time to get together, eat, talk, laugh, wander around, talk some more and finally, eventually, work on our writing.  We met at Saul's house, where he first treated me to a delicious salad and some refreshing lemonade.  Then we were off to the 1369 Coffee House to write and practice another key authorial skill: not paying for anything.

Perhaps the longest novel in the English language is <em>The Story of the Vivian Girls</em> written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darger">Harvey Darger</a>; it runs to 15,143 pages.  Also, the letters MNW, if rotated upside down, spell MNW.
