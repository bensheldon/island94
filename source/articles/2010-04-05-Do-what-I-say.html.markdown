Peter Klausler's <a href="http://klausler.com/cargo.html">"</a><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://klausler.com/cargo.html">Principles of the American Cargo Cult"</a> is one of my favorite statements (even more when applied to the idea of "best practices").</span></strong>
<blockquote><strong>II. Causality is selectable</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> All interconnection is apparent</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Otherwise, complicated explanations would be necessary.</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The end supports the explanation of the means</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">A successful person's explanation of the means of his success is highly credible by the very fact of his success.</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> You can succeed by emulating the purported behavior of successful people</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong></strong> This is the key to the cargo cult.  To enjoy the success of another, just mimic the rituals he claims to follow.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Your idol gets the blame if things don't work out, not you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>You have a right to your share</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">You get to define your share.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Your share is the least you will accept without crying injustice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Celebrate getting more than your share.</p>
