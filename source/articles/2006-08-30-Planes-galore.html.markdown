I'm currently in Washington, DC for a VISTA Leader training; rather I'm in Virginia, an hour and a $50 cab ride away from our nation's capitol.  An upshot is that the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum (they have two, the second is on the National Mall) is only a short shuttle trip away from my hotel.  The museum is a humongous hanger chock-full of airplanes, spacecraft and other strangers to the earth.
