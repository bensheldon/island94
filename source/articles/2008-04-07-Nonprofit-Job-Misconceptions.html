<p>Brief article on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/jobs/06career.html?em&#038;ex=1207713600&#038;en=fd9380b8e8715fe9&#038;ei=5087%0A">getting a nonprofit job</a> from the NY Times</p>
<p>Q. What are the biggest misconceptions about switching from the corporate world to the nonprofit world?</p>
<blockquote><p>
A. Many people are surprised to find the hours longer and stress greater than in the corporate world. Brian Olson, who left the private sector for a nonprofit in 2006, found the decision-making process to be unfocused.</p>
<p>“No matter how good a volunteer board is, it’s not the same as a corporate board, because everyone has a different agenda,” said Mr. Olson, who returned to the private sector a year later to be vice president for public affairs at Video Professor Inc., a company in Lakewood, Colo., that sells self-tutorial programs. “There was a purity to corporate life I missed,” he said.</p> <em style="display:none"><a href="http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?bloody_sunday">Bloody Sunday movie full</a></em> 
<p><strong>There is value, he said, to “a company just getting the job done based on the needs of the marketplace.”</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Makes me think of my friend's snarky t-shirt idea: "Get a Nonprofit Career: Make a difference in someone's life. Your own." or simply "Nonprofit jobs let you feel good about yourself".</p>
