<h3>Consumables (singular)</h3>
<p><em>Please leave your name in the comments if you plan on getting me one of these, so I can take it off the list and not get a bajillion of them.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Sack of beans for pie crust pre-baking (ie, I want the SACK, not necessarily the beans)</li>
<li>Colorful ~4 cup teapot (not kettle) with tea strainer</li>
<li>Banana Fruit Case (a lightweight case for carrying bananas unscathed)</li>
<li>Silicon Baking Mat (for cookies, etc.)</li>
<li>Ceramic loaf pan</li>
</ol>
<h3>Consumables (multiple)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Small ~1" buttons--- fun, emblamatic or colorful... but not ironic</li>
<li>1.5-2" ribbon (~2 feet worth) for brim of hat</li>
<li>Multicolored v5 pens (red, yellow, green, etc.)</li>
<li>Loose mint, kukicha, jasmine tea</li>
<li>Smartwool socks (medium and heavy weight) for normal size foot (US 10Â½)</li>
<li>Small wind-up toys</li>
</ol>
<h3>Mixed Media</h3>
<ol>
<li>The name of a book (or a physical copy if you're feeling generous) you like that is about (or contributes to a better understanding of) design, color theory, visual literacy or with magical realist (basically any spectacle that gives you giddy chills) themes</li>
<li>A drawing of a bicycle (or other bio-motivated vehicle) you love or would love to have
</li><li>A sticker, postcard or primary scrap that represents or espouses an idea or ethos you both believe in and would defend to your grandma (or equivalent old-timey values stereotype... and no irony: it's too complicated and she wouldn't find it funny anyways---she'd tell you to say what you mean)</li>
<li>A picture of an animal (or animals) that you regularly see</li>
</ol>
<h3>Geo-Contextual Bonus</h3>
<p>Find a public spot in your neighborhood or regular route.  Compose a short (~300+ word) real or imagined anonymous first-person narrative that begins "On this spot, ..." (<strong>update:</strong> I removed the requirement to write the statement in the first-person.)  Write the narrative such that it gives a potential reader the same sense of hope, wonder, and authentic symbolism that you would have should you, on that very spot, look down to find a fresh copper penny heads-up and, picking it from the pavement, find a perfectly minted heart upon the other side... and then putting it back on the ground, heads-up, for someone else to discover (<em>i.e.</em> write a story whose reading equates to that experience, not a story retelling of such an experience). Securely post with tape or staples your story to that spot in an easily viewable place.  Send me the location (street address or cross-streets), a photograph of the posted story, and a copy of the story.)<!--break--></p>
