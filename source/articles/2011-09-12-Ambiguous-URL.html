<em>Photo from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/paularamsay/status/111634486302740481/">awesome teacher @paulramsay</a> who used PrintAndShare.org to<a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=617291"> share his classroom's DonorsChoose Project.</a></em>

As a result of building <a href="http://printandshare.org/">PrintAndShare.org</a> I am hyper-sensitive to the drawbacks of URLs---which is my service's weakest link. I'm using bit.ly shortened URLs that unfortunately have an ambiguous mix of upper and lower-case letters; ambiguous both in terms of typeface (els and ones may look identical), but also that many people expect URLs to ignore case; for bit.ly that can be difference between reaching the specified DonorsChoose project page or... well... <em>anything</em> else on the internet which, statistically-speaking, I can say is something they definitely don't wish to see.

Regardless, I'm disappointed that <a href="http://feedback.bit.ly/forums/5239-suggestions/suggestions/349037-only-use-uppercase-chars-for-short-urls-to-make-tr?tracking_code=69d77a7a35cbe5096ca77ca500b0a67a">bit.ly doesn't acknowledge the need for transcribable URLs</a>. Below is a ticket, since closed, from their support forum (I've reformatted it):
