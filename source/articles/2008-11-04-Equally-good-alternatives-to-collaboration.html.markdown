<p>Yesterday I posted an article that sought to give a broader frame to the idea of <a href="http://island94.org/articles/how-create-cross-sector-nonprofit-value">cross-sector nonprofit collaboration</a>: placing collaboration within a process of negotiation to create new value.  Today I will break down negotiation a little bit further to show why I think it's important to take a broader frame  of things and maybe even <a href="http://island94.org/articles/how-create-cross-sector-nonprofit-value#comment-3761">get semantic</a>. <strong>Updated to add:</strong> :-)</p>
<p>When I'm talking about negotiation, I'm really talking about one particular piece of community engagement. Community engagement is all about self-evaluation (what can we offer the community?), communications/outreach (sending <em>and</em> receiving), and creating opportunities for participation---leadership, governance, programming and volunteerism all included.  Negotiation is the piece where you are actively communicating with specific members of the community: individuals, groups, organizations, businesses and government.</p>
<p>So if collaboration is just one option within negotiation, what are the others?  To that I really like the Thomas-Kilman Conflict Management Model: </p>
<p><img src="http://island94.org/files/island94.org/Thomas-Kilman Conflict Management Model.png" title="Thomas-Kilman Conflict Management Model" /></p>
<p><strong>Assertiveness</strong> (Y-Axis) is the extent to which you attempt to satisfy your own concerns, values, or interests.</p>
<p><strong>Cooperativeness</strong> (X-Axis) is the extent to which you attempt to satisfy their conncerns, values or interests.</p>
<p>It's designed specifically for individual conflict management situations, but I think it really helps to illuminate the different ways you can interact with another party that intentionally produces an outcome. </p>
<p>What I like about the instrument is that it's non-judgemental; none of the strategies are intrinsically <em>the best</em>; instead the best is the one that is most effective or appropriate in the situation at hand.  Not every situation can be collaborative because of limited time, resources, or <a href="http://island94.org/articles/nonprofit-competition-concept-map">competing values and interests</a>.  </p>
<p> Understanding the different approaches you can take to---as I said yesterday---create value, is important and provides a broader framework with which you can understand your organization's place in the community, and act to positively and iteratively transform its actions.</p>
