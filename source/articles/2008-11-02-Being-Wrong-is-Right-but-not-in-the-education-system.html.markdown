<p>I listened to the TED talk of <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">Sir Ken Robinson</a> on education from the <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisbrogan/status/986668588">tweet of Chris Brogan</a>.   </p>
<p>The short quote:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>
If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is a lot more there about how the education system is built to get people into college as an end in and of itself.</p>
<p>Sir Robinson also mentioned Picasso's quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.<br />
</p></blockquote>
