I like taking on the role of facilitator to help people realize their potential, whatever it might be. In a strategic planning class I audited last year, I found myself spending more time (and enjoying myself more) turning <em>other people's</em> vague concepts into plans, than I did my own. Many of the AmeriCorps*VISTA members I work with have trouble recognizing their abilities, expressing their roles, and most importantly, translating their experiences into a narrative they can parlay into brighter pastures. I've learned a lot about how to work with them to do this.

<strong>This I've learned</strong>: no one ever has everything they need, and not even everything they want. Being able to make do with with what you got ("have" for the grammar police), is one of those key lifetime skills.

The following substitutional characteristics are how I try to make do with what I've got. These are for use in situations where I have to persuade someone of my abilities or those of something I represent or anything that requires more than a broad smile (though that goes far as well)
