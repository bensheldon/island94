On Slashdot today was an <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/16/135209">entry</a> about <a href="http://www.meangene.com/google/design_for_google.html">Google Search if it was designed for Google</a>.  Basically redesigning the page for a higher pagerank.


Fun, but the interesting thing was a <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=329457&cid=20998511">comment</a> from the comments:

<blockquote>
Should read: What if Google was a useless site...

...and had to design for Google?

Lets see... counter examples... how about searching Google for the word "shipping". What do you know, UPS and Fedex are #1 and #2, and their front pages aren't a mess of useless, Google-pleasing crap. Maybe because they are real businesses and aren't pandering some direct ship junk or get rich quick scheme.

Makes sense, and is the basis for what I tell people who are concerned about SEO disproportionately to having a useful and relevant website: concentrate on having a good service and a useful website first.
