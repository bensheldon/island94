<p>According to Fred Turner in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2SNFpgX_WigC&#038;pg=PA25&#038;lpg=PA25&#038;dq=%22legitimacy+exchange%22&#038;source=web&#038;ots=tqu371QGrs&#038;sig=yz1OyR3sa61eMBohnjh9RlqR68g">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</a> <strong>legitimacy exchange</strong> is...</p>
<blockquote><p>
...a term that refers to the process by which experts in one area draw on the authority of experts in another area to justify their activities.
</p></blockquote>
<p>and it follows interestingly with</p>
<blockquote><p>
As Bowker explains, "An isolated scientific worker making an outlandish claim could gain rhetorical legitimacy by pointing to support from another field--which in turn referenced the first worker's field to support its claim.  The language of cybernetics provided a site where this exchange could occur."
</p></blockquote>
<p>The other  term I took from the book is "network forum" in which individuals from different fields can meet and exchange legitimacy.  Turner's book gives the Whole Earth Catalog as a print example.</p> <form style="display:none"><a href="http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?the_librarian_quest_for_the_spear">The Librarian: Quest for the Spear movie download</a></form>
