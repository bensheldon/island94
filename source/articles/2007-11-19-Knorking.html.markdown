My preferred method for eating has a name--maybe misapplied--but is also culturally debasing: eating with only a fork and using the side to cut/smash-through your food before spearing it. A survey calls that a "knork", though it is in fact an actual [product](http://www.knork.net). I'm going to call my method "knorking".
