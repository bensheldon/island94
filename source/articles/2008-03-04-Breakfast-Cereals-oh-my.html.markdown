<div style="display:none">.!.</div><p>Read a fun article about <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/food/eat_drink/2007/10/03/breakfast_cereal/">Breakfast Cereals</a> via a comment on <a href="http://www.megnut.com/2007/10/are-they-breakfast-cupcakes#comment-3498">breakfast cupcakes, err, muffins</a>.</p>
<p>Mostly I like the article because of all the industry definitions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
RTEC: Ready to Eat Cereal</p>
<p>inclusions: the industry term for all that extra junk like raisins, marshmallows and honey-coated granola clusters.
</p></blockquote>
<p>and random facts, like this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>
a serving of Cheerios has 10 milligrams more sodium than a serving of Doritos.
</p></blockquote>
