This lede is the baseline from which I think any discussion of contemporary journalism should begin:
<blockquote>There have been various proposals to “save journalism” from the crisis brought on by digitalization. But by and large these ideas have less to do with meeting the information needs of a democratic society than with preserving the profit potential of existing media outlets.</blockquote>
The one change I would make is to put "crisis" also in quotation marks in order to show that the crisis-metaphor is just one frame pushed by incumbent media outlets. Another frame would be "new opportunities" or "focus shift" or "changing landscape". The above is from "<a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3937">Public Media and the Decommodification of News"</a> published in FAIR's (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting) <a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=21&amp;extra_issue_id=245"><em>Extra!</em></a>
