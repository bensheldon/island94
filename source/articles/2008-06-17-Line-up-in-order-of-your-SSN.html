<p>The IRS is using the last two digits of your Social Security Number to determine <a href="http://www.irs.gov/irs/article/0,,id=180250,00.html">when you'll receive your Economic Stimulus</a> (e.g. free money i.e. your children's money).  </p>
<blockquote><p>
Paper checks will also go out based on Social Security number. For Social Security numbers ending in 00 through 09, the paper checks will be mailed starting May 9 and will continue through May 16. A similar process will be repeated in the following weeks. </p>
<p>Please allow additional delivery time, perhaps 3 to 5 days, since the paper checks are being sent through the mail.<br />
