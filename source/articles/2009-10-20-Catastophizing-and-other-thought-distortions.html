This week's topic in my Critical and Creative Thinking class is stress and stress-relieving exercises. I get a kick out of the table of thought distortions brought on by stress from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071234/"><em>Challenging and changing stress-producing thinking</em></a> by Felice E Miller published in the Western Journal of Medicine, 2001 January;  174 (1): 49–50.

"Catastrophizing" also reminds me of old woman in the film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114787/"><em>Underground</em></a> that continually says "It's a catastrophe!" (or "katastrofa" because it's Serbo-Croatian/BCE)---which my girlfriend and I like to repeat ad naseum.
