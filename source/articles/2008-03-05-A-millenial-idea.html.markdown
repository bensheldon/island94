<p>A New York Times article on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/nyregion/05incentive.html">paying kids based on their standardized test scores</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> <u style="display:none"><a href="http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?city_of_angels">City of Angels dvd</a></u> 
...a seventh-grade English class was asked one morning if there were too many standardized tests. Every hand in the room shot up to answer with a defiant yes. But at the same time, the students all agreed that receiving money for doing well on a test was a good idea, saying it made school more exciting, and made doing well more socially acceptable.

<p>Sounds an awful lot like the standard beef with millenials: entitlement and "everyone gets a trophy".  Of course, 7th graders are too young to be millenials, so maybe millenials are already in school administrative positions.  The eldest (born 1981) would be 27.</p>
