<p>A few weeks ago I hiked the <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?q=Providence,+RI,+USA&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=41.92353,-71.75776&#038;spn=0.00372,0.009388&#038;t=h&#038;z=17&#038;om=1">Walkabout Trail</a> in Northwestern Rhode Island with my friend <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/helenday/">Helen</a>.  The trail was gorgeously green and mossy with many fun frogs, toads and critters.  We hiked the eight miles (which cuts for shorter walks) in a little over three hours, which was a great pace leading up to a cooling swim in the adjoining pond afterwards.</p>
