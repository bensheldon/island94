<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/31/how-voters-are-susce.html">Thoughts of mortality</a> make people entrench their beliefs. (via boingboing).  It also makes people act in ways that boost their self-esteem, which, importantly, affects their <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/mktg_shiv_mortality.shtml">consumer behavior</a> (via google).

These seem to both be domestic studies.  I wonder how the US compares internationally in "mortality awareness".  (I'm guessing pretty low).
