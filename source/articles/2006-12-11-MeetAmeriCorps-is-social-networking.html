My pet project, <a href="http://meetamericorps.com">MeetAmeriCorps.com</a> has finally passed that development milestone that marks a "social network": Buddylists.  To be a little more haute, we've decided to call them "contact lists", but the concept is the same: you can demarcate people who you like/know/want-to-be-on-your-contact-list.

Since I haven't really been advertising it too heavily, Meet AmeriCorps <em>was</em> a directory--now it's a "social network"--of AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps*VISTA volunteers who are either currently serving or alumni.  It's pretty neat stuff, doesn't look to shabby and, disclosing I am the lead developer on the project, actually kind've useful.

We put together MeetAmeriCorps.com to fill what I see as a sorely lacking need.  <a href="http://americorps.gov">AmeriCorps</a> and VISTA are essentially-governmental, national-service programs that mostly places full-time, stipended volunteers with community organizations.  AmeriCorps speaks of itself as a "network" that is creating a "national service movement".  Unfortunately, it doesn't have the capacity to truly achieve this because, in my opinion and experience, AmeriCorps and VISTA members generally <strong>do not</strong>:
<ol>
	<li>communicate with other members serving with other organizations (even organizations inside a single community)</li>
	<li>self-identify as AmeriCorps volunteers</li>
	<li>collaborate on developing resources and capacity</li>
</ol>
AmeriCorps and VISTA currently provide <a href="http://vistaolinc.net">some</a> <a href="http://nationalserviceresources.org/resources/listservs/index.php">tools</a> and <a href="http://nationalserviceresources.org">resources</a> to achieve #3, but I believe that #3 cannot be achieved with volunteers being able to effectively communicate and identify themselves as AmeriCorps both to each other and the outside world.

Meet AmeriCorps seeks to provide an easy-to-use tool for AmeriCorps members to meaningfully interact with one another both within service, and outside of it.  I hope this will improve the experience of being an AmeriCorps or VISTA volunteer and contribute towards creating a true network and movement.
