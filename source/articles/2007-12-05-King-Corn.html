<p> <div style="display:none"><a href="http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?i_love_trouble">I Love Trouble film</a></div> I saw the movie King Corn last night at Harvard. It was ok.  The best part I thought was when they interviewed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Butz">Earl Butz</a>, a Secretary of Agriculture in the 1970s that instigated a major food production policy shift.</p>
<p>Earl said that his change in policy led to a decrease in the amount of money people spent on food (from ~40% to 15-20%) which led to the economic prosperity of today.  (eg more disposable income, more consumption, expanded economy).</p>
<p>Clever.  Though after reading his wikipedia entry, apparently he wasn't so clever in other respects.  Definitely didn't mention <em>that</em> in the movie.</p>
