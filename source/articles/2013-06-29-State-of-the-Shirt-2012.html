&nbsp;

2012 was a big year for <a href="http://dayoftheshirt.com">Day of the Shirt</a>: it moved from being one of a constellation of hobby projects to becoming the main focus of my spare development time and a largely self-sustaining business.
<h2>As a project</h2>
As a technology project, Day of the Shirt went through a lot of changes in 2012. Including:
<ul>
	<li>It started off the year featuring just 10 t-shirt vendors. By the end of the year, that number had grown to 21 vendors, including some that featured multiple shirt sales.</li>
	<li>The technology stack morphed a lot. Originally built in PHP, I first rewrote the backend in Node.JS (though I was still using PHP for HTML templating). Then, as the year closed out, I began the task of rewriting it for Ruby on Rails.</li>
	<li>In moving Day of the Shirt from PHP to Node (and towards Rails), I improved the instrumentation and error logging a lot. This meant I'm much more quickly able to respond to changes in t-shirt vendors websites and ensure that designs on Day of the Shirt are up-to-date.</li>
	<li>Added a daily RSS Feed</li>
	<li>Started pushing daily updates to Facebook (in addition to <a href="http://twitter.com/dayoftheshirt">Twitter</a>) with about 1,500 likes on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Day-of-the-Shirt/255292914596736">Facebook Page</a> by year's end.</li>
</ul>
<h2>As a business</h2>
2012 marked the first time that Day of the Shirt ever earned any money. Like:
<ul>
	<li>After 1.5 years of having Google Adsense advertisements on Day of the Shirt, I <em>finally</em> received my first payout in February.</li>
	<li>In addition to showing advertisements, I also started adding affiliate links to shirts. The majority of t-shirt vendors I list don't have affiliate programs, but I went ahead and signed up as an affiliate for those that do.</li>
	<li>Because I was actually earning some revenue for the first time, in November I completed the process of registering Day of the Shirt as a Sole Proprietorship in the City of San Francisco.</li>
	<li>The income has allowed me to pay a designer to help with the visual and interaction design and a developer to help migrate the t-shirt collection scripts to Ruby: having already migrated a lot of automated scripts from PHP to Javascript, I was happy to lighten my load and focus on building out the website itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>As a passion</h2>
I've always juggled several web projects (like <a href="http://brompt.com">Brompt</a> and <a href="http://panlexicon">Panlexicon</a>... and <a href="http://www.island94.org/tag/portfolio/">all of this</a>), but 2012 really cemented my commitment and interest in Day of the Shirt:
<ul>
	<li>Traffic went up, way up. Over the course of the year Day of the Shirt went from having 200 daily visitors in January to more than 8,000 by December.</li>
	<li>People started writing about Day of the Shirt on Reddit and online forums. And tweeting about it. And in November Day of the Shirt was featured on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5964206/day-of-the-shirt-collects-daily-deals-on-t+shirts-from-around-the-web">Lifehacker</a>.</li>
	<li>People started emailing me (and we don't feature our email address very prominently): thanking me for the website and suggesting new daily t-shirt vendors to add to the website.</li>
</ul>
2012 was a really important year for Day of the Shirt and has set a lot of the foundation for improvements and new features I'm adding in 2013.
