<p>Today I was helping a work-study student down the hall from my office on a film studies essay.  Her assignment was to analyze what critics had to say on Woody Allen, specifically whether his films were comedies or dramas.</p>
<p>She had only read one of three critics (<a href="http://people.bu.edu/rcarney/carncult/woody.shtml">Carney</a>) but it was interesting to map out with her what her finished assignment would look like; she was (as was typical of my undergraduate experience) unsure of what the final product would look like, other than a page count (12-15).  I gave her my best idea I could of what I would expect:</p>
<p>Coming up with a thesis, even as simple as "Many critics disagree as to whether Woody Allen's films are comedic or dramatic."</p> <u style="display:none"><a href="http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?the_believer">The Believer buy</a></u> 
<p>Then deconstruct and explain those elements in a logical fashion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who is Woody Allen, what are his films and why do we care enough to write 12-15 pages on what other people think of him.</li>
<li>Who are the said critics, what are their backgrounds and how may that affect their opinions (which we still aren't sure we care about)?</li>
<li>What defines a comedy or drama?  Can they agree on that?(nope)</li>
<li>What are they using to apply these definitions to? (the scenes).  Describe and deconstruct.</li>
<li>Restate what is now obvious (the thesis)</li>
<li>Conclude with why all this is important? ---this was my response to her confusion with the teacher asking for a personal reflection</li>
</ol>
<p>I thought it was interesting how that one critic strongly seems to use fantasy (I only scanned  the first few pages) to define a comedy. And that Woody Allen is masterful at creating squirmy, deep situations, and ending them prematurely before any sort of conclusion can be made (the non-dramatic part).</p>
