<p>I had a two hour layover at Dulles Airport.  Before I left, I was showing off my camera to my boss .  It shoots full frame (640 x 480) mpeg-4 video; that's over an hour of video on a two gigabyte card.  My boss told me to make lots of videos.</p>
<p>I shot and edited this entirely while waiting for my connecting flight.  I waited till my final destination to upload it though.</p>
<p>The video quality is a little poor from multiple compressions.  I edited it in iMovie and had to export and reimport the video in order to timelapse it to the speed I wanted.</p>
