Also interesting description of two 300-ton weights that sit on the 58th floor to damp swaying motions.

via [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock_Tower). Researched due to an article today about MIT [suing Frank Gehry](http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2007/11/06/mit_sues_gehry_citing_leaks_in_300m_complex/) over the Stata Center.
