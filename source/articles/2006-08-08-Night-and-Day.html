I spent the weekend in the Connecticut suburbs with some friends, camping out in their parent's backyard and playing Marco Polo at midnight.

The tent we had was huge; we were only five but it easily could have fit 10.  The ground was surprisingly flat and the grass soft; it wasn't a spectacular night's sleep, but I've definitely had worse.
