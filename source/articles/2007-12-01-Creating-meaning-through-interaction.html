<blockquote>
[Bakhtin explores] the idea that language is indeed ambiguous, but whereas deconstruction would highlight this ambiguity as the inability of words to convey precise meaning, Bakhtin welcomes this vagueness of language as a means by which to create meaning dialogically. Indeed, in describing the nature of the polyphonic novel, Bakhtin sees the entire scope of human life as a dialogic process whereby we find meaning only through our interactions with others.
</blockquote>

From a <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~honeyl/bakhtin/chap2a.html">thesis</a> entitled "What Hath Bakhtin Wrought? Toward a Unified Theory of Literature and Composition" by Lee Honeycut
