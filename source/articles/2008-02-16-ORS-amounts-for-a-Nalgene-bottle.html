For a 32oz Nalgene Bottle (the standard biggish one) of clean water, the Oral Rehydration Salt quantities are:

<ul>
<li>Slightly less than 1/2 teaspoon of Salt (0.43tsp. to be exact)</li>
<li>7.5 teaspoons of Sugar
</ul>

(Personal note: when you've made it correctly, it should taste like minusculey-sweet saliva)

Adapted from <a href="http://www.rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm#recipes">Rehydrate.org's ORS Recipe</a> based on 1 liter of water.

And the wikipedia entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_salt">Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)</a>
