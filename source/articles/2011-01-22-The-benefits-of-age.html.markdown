Havard Business Review's Dan Pallota <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/pallotta/2011/01/the-wisdom-years-the-value-of.html">quoted from Julia Moulden's book,Â <em>RIPE: Rich, Rewarding Work After 50</em></a>:
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>I can tell the difference between a customer who has a legitimate gripe with my company and one who is an alcoholic or has anger-management issues. At 25, I thought it was all and always about me.</li>
	<li>My bullshit meter is highly attuned because I've heard a lot of bullshit. At 25 I was naive enough to believe most of what everyone was dishing out.</li>
	<li>I have the confidence to know that if I don't understand some new business idea you're pitching to me it's not because I'm stupid. It's because you're not communicating it well. At 25 I was more prone to point the finger inward.</li>
	<li>I know that business construction projects cost about twice what you budgeted them to cost. At 25, I was continually shocked and unprepared when costly problems popped up or snags set projects back months.</li>
	<li>I know that being nice to people and being a good leader are two different things. At 25 I was nice to everyone. And not the best leader.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
I suggested in the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/pallotta/2011/01/the-wisdom-years-the-value-of.html#comment-132959702">comments</a> this addition:
<blockquote>My peers and I outnumber everyone else. At 25, people over 50 were few and far between which let me do a lot without someone looking over my shoulder and judging my work.</blockquote>
Which is really a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss_and_Howe">defining difference</a> between Boomers and Millennials: Millennials are coming of age with a lot more older people around then when Boomers came of age.

But I've also disagreed with Dan Pallota <a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/10/social-work-is-womens-work-so-we-dont-care/">before</a>. The population pyramid image is from <a href="http://www.flatrock.org.nz/topics/money_politics_law/boom_moves_along.htm">here</a>, which looks like it may have been copied out of a newspaper.
