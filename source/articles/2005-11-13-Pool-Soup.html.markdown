This is a short video that I shot of my neighbor&#8217;s pool.  Using my little Casio digicam and a camera mount consisting of a box of Trader Joe&#8217;s Green Tea, I taped some of the gusty winds we were getting today as they moved leaves around in the pool.  <br />

<p>The original tape was 27 minutes that I then cut frames from (by about a factor of 50) to give a time lapse effect.  If you watch the bottom right of the screen you can see the shadows shift as the sun moves overhead. I am not sure, but there is a quick round white reflection that moves across the pool that I think may be the moon.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
