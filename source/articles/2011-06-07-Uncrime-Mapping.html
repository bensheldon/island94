</a><a href="http://www.island94.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Trulia-Crime-Map.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2697" title="Trulia Crime Map" src="http://www.island94.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Trulia-Crime-Map-600x391.png" alt="" width="600" height="391" /></a>

I really don't understand the appeal of crime maps. Trulia, a housing search tool, just launched a <a href="http://www.trulia.com/crime/">crime map, too</a> (via <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/06/02/trulia-crime-map-helps-you-find-safe-living-places/">FlowingData</a>, whose commenters are full of criticism). Since Trulia doesn't have data (now <em>that's </em>something to map with transformative potential) for Boston, I had to look up my <a href="http://www.trulia.com/crime/#!cook-il/15/41.90543,-87.68471/Chicago,IL,Humboldt_Park/">friends' neighborhood in Chicago</a>. Above is a heatmap I photoshopped showing the uncrime---the area is clearly rife with it.

Below is <a href="http://www.odt.org/southupmaps.htm">McArthur's Universal Corrective Map of the World</a>. Think about it.
