From a Frank Chimero jam: <a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/idea/">"How to Have an Idea"</a>:
<blockquote>Stop being a weenie and just go make something. Judge its value after you finish and before you share.

An observation: Creative people romanticize mistakes and process. But there is no process if you don't start. No one crumples a blank sheet of paper.</blockquote>
