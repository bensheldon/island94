This morning, coming home from my gym I went down into the Chinatown T-stop (<a href="/node/9">here</a>).  For the past few months, the escalator has been out of service and over that period become increasingly dismantled.  In my investigation of this I would find I had become (booming voice) <em>a defender of democracy-ocracy-cracy</em>.

	<p>I find most mechanical things neato, especially when large, dirty and taken apart.  Due to this, I happily pulled out my camera and began taking a few pictures of the escalator husk because, hey, why not.  Little did I know that I could be abetting&#8230; <em>a terrorist</em>.</p>

	<p>Fortunately for myself and my nation, the T attendant came out of her box and asked, &#8220;Are you supposed to be doing that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Feeling a bit like Galileo, I hesitatingly replied, &#8220;Umm, no.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t be taking pictures of that.  There are terrorists and we need to protect the station.  You will have to delete those pictures&#8221;</p>

	<p>Rather than point out that terrorists could still just as easily take the elevator if they were unable or unwilling to take the stairs, I dutifully complied-<del>they were dark and blurry anyway</del>-thus cementing my place as a <em>defender of democracy-ocracy-cracy</em>.  </p>

	<p>Looking back on those times, I feel fortunate that I was dressed as my alter ego, <em>average white guy</em>, or else the my experience could have been, in the name of freedom, drastically different.</p>

	<p>Despite my lack of new T photos, as a protector of all things American, I feel it&#8217;s my civic duty to post a picture from the archive.  She&#8217;s proud; and what woman wouldn&#8217;t be to date a <em>defender of democracy-ocracy-cracy</em>.</p>
