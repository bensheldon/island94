<p>I just finished reading a New York Times editorial "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/opinion/16mon4.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Is the Supreme Court About to Kill Off the Exclusionary Rule?</a>" that ended with this line:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Nothing can destroy a government more quickly,” the [Federal Supreme Court noted in Mapp v. Ohio], “than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the charter of its own existence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also just finished reading Cory Doctorow's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Brother-Cory-Doctorow/dp/0765319853?tag=particculturf-20">Little Brother</a> (which you can <a href="http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2466">download free</a> under Creative Commons).</p>
