In the news is Obama's top-level administration application questions, e.g.
<blockquote>Please furnish copies of all resumes and biographical statements issued by you or any other entity at your discretion or with your consent within the past 10 years.</blockquote>
and while some <a href="http://www.stlrecruiting.com/2008/11/obama-adminstra.html">others</a> seemed to have histrionics about it, I happen to agree with the asking of the questions. At least, based on the assumption that the emphasis is on transparency and a complete as possible picture of the applicant, i.e, these are weeding questions to determine an applicant's veracity and seriousness in applying, not that any particular item would automatically disqualify someone (at least, I assume this based upon my experience as a hirer and constructor of applications)

This led to some discussion with peers, and I was happy to hear that the first question people ask of interviewees is <blockquote>How did you prepare for this interview?</blockquote>
