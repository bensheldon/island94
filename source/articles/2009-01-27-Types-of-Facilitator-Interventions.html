<p>Flipping through <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Facilitators-Fieldbook-2nd-Tom-Justice/dp/0814473148/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1233072760&amp;sr=1-1">The Facilitator's Fieldbook (Second Edition)</a></em> I really liked their listing/categorization of the different Types of Process Consultation.Â  It's a straighforward breaking apart of the different methods one might use to facilitate an interaction (<em>normal-speak translation</em>: talk to people)</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Active Listening</strong>: Paying close attention to both what is being said and the processes that are occurring, leading to highlighting clarification, summarizing, and consensus building.</li>
<li><strong>Inquiry</strong>: Questions and probes to raise data, focus attention, and/or stimulate diagnostic thinking; surfacing data for the group to look at.</li>
<li><strong>Observation and feedback</strong>: Seeing what is going on with an individual or the group and then (a) describing in behavioral terms what they are doing; (b) reflecting their emotional state; and (c) interpreting the underling dynamics of what is going on.</li>
<li><strong>Concretization</strong>: Pushing people to be concrete and specific to get beyond generalizations.</li>
<li><strong>Historical reconstruction</strong> : Looking back over events to force a reconstruction and review of what was done and how it was done (emphasizing the process dimensions).</li>
<li><strong>Including process focus</strong>: Building in process analysis periods, feedback sessions, and process discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive inputs</strong>: Concepts or ideas shared with the group to help members understand something.</li>
<li><strong>Skill building</strong>: Interjecting brief learning activities to enhance the capabilities of the group members in some needed competency (e.g., feedback, problem solving).</li>
<li><strong>Counseling/guidance</strong>: Helping the group or individuals look at themselves and actively engage in solving their own problems</li>
<li><strong>Designing processes</strong>: Designing and managing activities, methods, or exercises to effectively reach desired outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Structural alternatives</strong>: Suggesting options for group membership, subgroups, interaction patterns, work allocation, roles and responsibilities, and so forth.</li>
<li><strong>Content suggestions or recommendations</strong>: Providing input or opinions concerning the content the group is working on; recommending what the group should do about some aspect of the group's content.</li>
</ol>

<p>The book also breaks out some other dimensions of your interaction:</p>
