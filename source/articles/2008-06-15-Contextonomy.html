<p>Aha!  I knew there had to be a word for misusing review quotes.  From this week's <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/nl/krcv.htm">World Wide Words</a>:</p> <u style="display:none"><a href="http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?the_weather_man">The Weather Man hd</a></u> 
<blockquote><p>
Such extracts from reviews are called "pull quotes" in the jargon;massaging them into more favourable versions is "quote doctoring". Another word, with apologies to Stephen Potter, is "quotemanship"(or "quotesmanship"). "Contextomy" is yet another term, one used principally by academics in reference to literary misquoting. The ending "-tomy" means cutting up and has here been neatly reversed into "context". It was created by the historian Milton Mayer in 1966 in reference to a much more significant issue, the misquoting<br />
of the Torah for propaganda purposes by Julius Streicher, editor ofthe Nazi paper Der St√ºrmer in Weimar-era Germany.
