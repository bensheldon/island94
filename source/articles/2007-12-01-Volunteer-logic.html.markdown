<blockquote>
Last April, the Corporation reported in its Volunteering <http://www.nationalservice.gov/about/volunteering/states.asp>  in America study that while America’s overall volunteer rate remains at historically high levels, nearly 21 million of the over 61.2 million Americans who volunteered for nonprofit organizations in 2005 didn’t volunteer the following year.  This represents an estimated annual loss to nonprofits of approximately $30 billion dollars worth of volunteer labor.
