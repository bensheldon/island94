"Limiting the CIA's interrogation methods to those in the Army Field Manual would be dangerous because the manual is publicly available and easily accessible on the Internet..."

President W. Bush on his <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030800304.html?hpid=topnews">veto of a CIA waterboarding ban</a>.  Of course, the <a href="http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure">Operating Manual for Guantanamo Bay Prison</a> is on the internet too.  But then again, apparently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/opinion/19thu1.html">Guantanamo isn't effective either</a>.
