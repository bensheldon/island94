<p>I was forwarded this from <a href="http://alinapazwrites.blogspot.com/">Angelina</a>, who apparently read it on the side of her Starbucks cup (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">"There is a subtle difference between a mission and a promise. A mission is something you strive to accomplish -- a promise is something you are compelled to keep. <strong>One is individual, the other is shared.</strong> When a mission and a promise are one and the same . . . that's when mountains are moved and races are won."</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Hala Moddelmog,<br /> 
Pres. and CEO,<br />
Susan G. Komen for the Cure.</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The last sentence is mostly pablum, but from yesterday's post about <a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/02/online-fundraising-please-do-it-right/">dialogue and creating a shared community</a>, I think it's important to think about not only what your own committment is, but also the expectations you are committing to with others.Â  In other words, a mission is a statement, a promise is a contract.</p>
