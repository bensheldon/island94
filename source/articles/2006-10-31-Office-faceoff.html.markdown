<strong>The Home Office</strong>

Laptop, calendar, cellphone, sunlight, cat.

Molly is cute, furry and warm.  She doesn't take dictation though.

<strong>The Work Office</strong>

A hardened concrete box deep in the windowless bowels of UMass Boston. Not my desk, but respective.

Danielle is hardworking, hilarious and awesome.  She doesn't take dictation either.
