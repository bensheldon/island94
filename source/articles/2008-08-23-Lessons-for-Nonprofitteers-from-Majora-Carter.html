This is more notes from last weekend's Craigslist Foundation's <a href="http://craigslistfoundation.org/index.php?page=ny2008">Nonprofit Bootcamp</a>.

Majora Carter, founder of Sustainable South Bronx, gave the afternoon keynote (I think the afternoon speech of a conference should be called a plenary). She spoke from experience in designing socially and ecologically sustainable projects. I think she covered some good points in her speech, but overall I felt like she was pitching to investors more than having an intimate discussion with peers---the latter being a tone I think Nancy Lublin nailed at last year's Bootcamp (<a href="http://craigslistfoundation.org/index.php?page=Keynotes">audio</a>; my <a href="http://island94.org/opinion-nonprofits">notes</a>). Also, I felt that her points were somewhat antagonistic (though perhaps reasonably so) but left out a sense of reality-check: yeah, you're pissing off The Man, but does that mean that you're changing society, or just being a nuisance?

	<li>Fight <em>for</em> something, not against something.</li>
	<li>Help can come in man forms</li>
	<li>Groundbreaking solutions abhor orthodoxy</li>
	<li>If nobody knows what you are doing, how are people going to care?</li>
	<li>Build on sucess and momentum. Why reinvent the wheel?</li>
	<li>If you feel like you have a target on your head, you are probably doing something right</li>
	<li>Be part of alliances that make sense for your organization</li>
	<li>When the time is right, don't be afraid to move on</li>

</ol>
