Okay.  You've got nature---neurons, brain chemicals, hormones, and of course, at the bottom of the cereal box, genes.  And then there's nurture, all those environmental breezes gusting about. And the biggest cliche in this field is how it is meaningless to talk about nature or nurture, only about their interaction.  And somehow, that truism rarely sticks.  Instead, somebody's got to go, and when a new gene is trotted out then when "firing off", "determines" behavior, environmental influences are inevitably seen as something irrelevant that have to go.

<p>The author also notes that the genome is called "code of codes" and the "holy grail" by un-sciency journalists.</p>
