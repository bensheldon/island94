I told my long-time friend Jason about my blog--honestly, no one reads this thing, probably for good reason--and he says, "Is it emo?  I won't do anything unless it's emo."  Yes, he's a precocious brat, but this is for you Jason.

<blockquote>
Sunday comes it's raaaaining,
My girl's here, she's taaaaaking
...her time
I want to fly away
So I won't have to say...

Give me my voice
It's making this choice
So hard to take.

Wooaaaa-o
Woooaaaa-o

Summer can't sustaaaain me,
The music's on, the paaaaarty
...will start
I think I'll walk away
So I won't have to say...


Give me some noise
It's taking my joy
Resigned to fate.

Woooaaaa-o

Resigned to fate.

Aaaah-oh

Wooooaaa-o
