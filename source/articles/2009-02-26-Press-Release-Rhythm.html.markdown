<p> Minimal comment on <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/02/12/microsoft_to_open_new_retail_stores_like_apple.html">Microsoft entering the retail space</a> with Apple-<em>esque</em> stores---dumb---but I liked the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're working hard to transform the PC and Microsoft buying experience at retail by improving <strong>the articulation and demonstration of the Microsoft innovation and value proposition</strong> so that it's clear, simple and straightforward for consumers everywhere."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> You do though have to mis-pronounce proposition as <em>proposation</em> to really maintain the flow. That would also help to further increase the irony of the ending clause.</p>
