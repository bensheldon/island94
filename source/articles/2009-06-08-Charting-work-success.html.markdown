This venn diagram on [How to be Happy in Business](http://whatconsumesme.com/2009/what-im-writing/how-to-be-happy-in-business-venn-diagram/) from Bud Caddell is making the rounds, and remember-worthy enough for me to post it here: ![how-to-be-happy-in-business-venn](2009-06-08-Charting-work-success/how-to-be-happy-in-business-venn-500x500.png "how-to-be-happy-in-business-venn")

Pair that with the other useful chart I like, Stephen Covey's Time Management Matrix (or Urgent/Important Matrix)---this one from [AwakeBlogger](http://www.awakeblogger.com/2008/07/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people-1-private-victory/) :
