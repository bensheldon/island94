<p> Having gone through an institutional hiring process---both as the hirer and the hiree---I am well aware of the intricacies of non-discriminatory practices.  Essentially: you can't base your decision on anything outside of the approved job description and qualifications.  Regardless, I got a hoot out of the following qualification on a job my friend sent me:</p>
<blockquote><p><p style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?passenger_57">Passenger 57 on dvd</a></p>
<p>Employee must be able to relate to other people beyond giving and receiving instructions: works well with co-workers or peers without exhibiting behavioral extremes; perform work activities requiring negotiating, instructing, supervising, persuading or speaking with others; and respond appropriately to criticism from a supervisor.
