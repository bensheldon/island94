This is a set of images from a self-journaling project I'm working on based around my media-consumption habits. A few months ago I designed a self-journaling worksheet for <a href="http://angelinacalderon.com">Angelina</a>, and she really liked the use of a blank face for the critical-reflectionÂ process---so that's one part of it. I just sent off Version 0 to be printed; I'll post some photos when it arrives.
