Despite it being a class on Critical <em>Thinking</em> I'm a little grossed out by "ethical, empathic and just" behavior being described as a deductive exercise.  But then again, I did agree with Justice Sotomayor's "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/06/05/sotomayor.speeches/index.html">wise-Latina</a>" remark.

The above is  Dr. Richard Paul and Dr. Linda Elder's <em><a href="www.criticalthinking.org/files/SAM-EthicalReasoning20051.pdf">Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning</a>.</em>
