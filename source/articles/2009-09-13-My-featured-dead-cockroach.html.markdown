<a href="http://www.island94.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wired-cockroach.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-708" title="wired-cockroach" src="http://www.island94.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wired-cockroach-500x468.png" alt="wired-cockroach" width="500" height="468" /></a>

A <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensheldon/1306195094/">photo</a> I took in the halls of UMass Boston was featured in a <em>Wired Magazine </em>(well, on the website) in "<a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/09/deathstench/">Universal ‘Death Stench’ Repels Bugs of All Types</a>".
<blockquote><em>Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensheldon/1306195094/">Flickr/bensheldon</a>. Note: This photo was chosen from a disturbingly <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/show/?q=dead+cockroach">large volume</a> of dead cockroach images on Flickr.</em></blockquote>
There is a tiny bit of controversy though: I was made aware the photo was being used when a <a href="http://www.tomtwigg.com/">good samaritan</a> emailed the author saying <em>Wired</em> had not respected the Creative Commons Attribution--<strong>Non-Commercial</strong>
