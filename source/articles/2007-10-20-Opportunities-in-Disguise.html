<p>Heard this quote I liked from <a href="http://namac.org">NAMAC keynote speaker <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/21cp/bio.html">Gary Chapman</a> of the  LBJ School of Public Affairs.  He was paraphrasing John Gardner:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The nation is filled with opportunities disguised as insoluble problems.
</p></blockquote><ul style="display:none"><li><a href="http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?gladiatress">Gladiatress rip</a></li></ul>
