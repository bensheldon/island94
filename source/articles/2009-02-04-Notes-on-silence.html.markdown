<p>My roommate (a teacher) left open this week's <em>Newsweek</em> with a movie review of the French film, <em><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/182529">The Class</a>,</em> that began with this quote, tattooed on one of the students and dubiously attributed to the Qu'ran:</p>
<blockquote><p>If your words are less important than silence, keep quiet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which sounds suspiciously similar to the Buddhist quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do not speak---unless it improves on <em><span style="font-style: normal;">silence</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Trying to google through Christian quotations, I found little in the way of direct quotations, though lots of <a href="http://www.therealpresence.org/chapel/howtoflw.htm">interpretation</a>. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">As a contemporary quote, I like <a href="http://www.cloudcult.com/">Cloud Cult</a>'s "The Deaf Girls Song", off of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Meaning-8-Cloud-Cult/dp/B000NQR7RK">The Meaning of 8</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Did you hear about the deaf girl<br />
The one whose song's gone number one<br />
Three minutes of silence on the radio<br />
It's the best damn gift for everyone</p></blockquote>
