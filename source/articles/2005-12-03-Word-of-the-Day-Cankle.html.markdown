<blockquote><strong>cankle</strong> (cangÂ·kel): <em>n.</em> the lower leg of one whose calf and ankle are not clearly differentiated.</blockquote>
Jess and I were out with her coworker Liz and fiance Adam tonight when we heard this gem for the first time. We were talking about all sorts of <em>blending</em>: back acne: backne; gigantic-enormous: ginormous, smother- suffocate: smufficate. How appropriate that we were eating out at Jose McIntyres: an eclectic and moderately edible mix of Irish pub and Mexican food.
