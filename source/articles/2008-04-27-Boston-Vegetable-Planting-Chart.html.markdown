I made a simple chart of approximate seed planting times for Boston (USDA Zone 6).  You can <a href="http://island94.org/files/island94.org/Boston Vegetable Planting Chart.pdf">download a printable PDF of the planting chart</a>.

Today I put together a simple raised bed in my backyard. I built it along the same design as the <a href="http://www.thefoodproject.org/agriculture/Internal1.asp?ID=601">Food Project's Build-a-Garden Program's planter</a>---which my landlord participated in last year.  Other than shoveling 1300 pounds of soil needed for an 8 x 4 raised bed, it was pretty easy.  The only really novel part is putting a sheet of weed-block between the ground and the planting soil to keep the vegetables from growing down into polluted city-dirt.
