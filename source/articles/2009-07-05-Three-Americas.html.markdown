My friend Thomas posted a status message to Facebook "wonders why Republicans hate America?". This is where I'm at:
<blockquote>Define your terms! :-) By "America" do you mean?
<ol>
	<li>a pluralist society striving for a more representative government and greater civil liberties</li>
	<li>a consensus society seeking a return to a more stable civic life built upon firm social and ethical principles</li>
	<li>a geo-political demarcation for a group of people equally as unexceptional as everyone else.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
