<p>I really like this post from Entry Level Living about <a href="http://entrylevelliving.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/sector-divisions-collaboration/">the need for nonprofits and for-profits to collaborate</a> in these dicy economic times.  She lays out some good examples of collaboration and ties it into a compelling sandwich.  But it also begins with a an false cliche (nonprofits war with the for-profits) and doesn't actually get beyond the the assumption that <em>collaboration</em> is an intrinsic good.  The interesting and unanswered piece (for anyone who isn't a millennial, like the Allison of Entry Level Living and I) is: <em>why the hooey should we care about collaboration?</em></p>
<p>The answer: you shouldn't.  <strong>You should care about creating value</strong>, collaboration is just a means to getting there (and not the only one, at that).  Entry Level Living lays out some fine examples that do create value, but doesn't provide a strict method for thinking about value-creation.</p>
<p>So let's talk about value:</p>
<p>Nonprofits tend to talk more about values---our mission, our vision, our culture of caring---than the <em>value</em> (no 's') we create. Most of the value we do talk about is tied up into our values. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_theory#Economics">value theory</a> of nonprofits mostly has to do with creating moral goods: things someone is morally obligated to strive for (education, self-reliance, non-violence, positive familial and community relations, etc.).  In <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/4969.html">nonprofit parlance</a> that is called <em>Social Value</em>.</p>
<p>We tend not to talk about the <em>Economic Value</em> we have: our brand and name-recognition; our well-developed skills or expertise; and our general social authority and legitimacy (a fancy way of saying people trust us)... to name a few.</p>
<p>While Social Value is good (duh!), it has no meaning in cross-sector collaboration: it's just not the business of business.  Economic Value <em>is</em> meaningful for cross-sector collaboration, and that's where nonprofits should be spending their time.  If you've ever heard someone say "<a href="http://island94.org/node/155/">Monetize your Core Competencies</a>", they're talking about your Economic Value, not your Social one.</p>
<p>So now that you know about value, how do you create it in cross-sector collaboration?  To begin with, we're going to toss the word <em>collobaration</em> and replace it with a broader and more neutral term: <strong>negotiation</strong>.  While collaboration may be a strategy within negotiation, negotiation encompasses the entire scope of communication that you may be engaged in.</p>
<p>Cross-sector negotiation means thinking of creative ways to combine your nonprofit's Economic Value with a for-profit's Economic Value in such a way that you <em>create more value than existed in the first place.</em>. In negotiation theory, this is called "joint value". In more metaphorical terms, you've just <a href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/creating_value/">enlarged the pie</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you've ever had a corporate volunteer day, you've done exactly this: you combined your social authority and legitimacy as do gooders with a for-profit's staff-as-volunteers.  The for-profit received CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) PR and personal development (the warm fuzzies) for staff; you received cheap labor; and both of you did it for less than the cost of an alternative plan (advertising campaign and professional staff development for them; part-time paid labor for you).</p>
<p>Nonprofits and for-profits aren't at war; they are just similar looking games with somewhat different rules.  The secret to winning is to look for cross-over skills, strategies and players.  Evaluating the economic value of your nonprofit is a good place to start.</p>
