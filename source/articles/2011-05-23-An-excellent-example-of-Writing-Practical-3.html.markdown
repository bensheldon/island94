I subscribe to too many media-strategy blogs, which rile me up from time to time with their lack of attention to content production---as in the act of writing itself. Sure, they're _strategy_ but the line ["Before running off to create content..." from Beth's Blog](http://www.bethkanter.org/content-rules/) made me think of the vast majority of people I know and have worked with who just can't write---as in the act itself. I made this note in Google Reader:

> I would say just start with Bloom's Taxonomy:

>

> 1. Blog quotes from other articles, blogs, reports, etc. Shit, quote your own emails if necessary. No commentary, just a one sentence citation/context. If you can't do this, don't move on to the next steps (heck, if you can't do this, you clearly are not engaged at all with your work). Duration: 15 min (assuming light editing/anxiety over appropriateness)

>

> 2. Same quotes as #1, but this time lightly criticize, compare or contrast between them or somehow contemporize. If you've built up a collection of quotes, it's fairly easy to pull 2 contrasting ones and write a light paragraph to fit between them with your analysis. Length: 30 min.(assuming you already have the quotes and can bang out a quick explanatory connection).

>

> 3. Write down a conversation that has already taken place. This requires a higher level of literacy, but you're basically rehashing the arguments you've already made---with maybe a brief conclusion where you say "I should have explained x better" (but don't actually explain it, just acknowledge you recognize the holes and let them sit). Duration: ~1 hour (depending on complexity and your level of honesty in narrative)

>

> 4. Original analysis: avoid at all costs. People who can bang out 500-1000 words of original, longform analysis are in full-time academic, strategy, creative or executive roles where they can probably carve out 4 hours for writing (writing may be their only job) and be none the worse. Or else they are top 1% writers. Or are sociopaths. Duration: longer than most of our jobs allow.

I originally wrote Maslow's Hierarchy instead of Bloom's Taxonomy... but whatever, a pyramid is a pyramid.
