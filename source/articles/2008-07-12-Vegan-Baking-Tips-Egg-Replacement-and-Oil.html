<p>During an AmeriCorps icebreaker, I matched my desire to learn vegan baking with someone who knew how.  Who say's icebreakers are worthless (well, I sometimes do).  I got the following two tips:</p>
<p><strong>Egg Substitute</strong>: Use an amount of water equal to an egg (maybe ~1/4 cup) and mix in  tablespoon of ground flax-seed</p>

<p> <strong>Best Oil</strong>: Coconut Oil is the best oil to use for moistness and tastiness.  Of course, it's really bad for you, but who cares.</p>
