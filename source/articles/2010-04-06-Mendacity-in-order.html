Augustine of Hippo's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Augustine.27s_taxonomy_of_lies">taxonomy of lies</a>, deduced from his book <em>On Lying (De Mendacio)</em> (395) in order of descending severity:
<ol>
<blockquote>
	<li>Lies in religious teaching.</li>
	<li>Lies that harm others and help no one.</li>
	<li>Lies that harm others and help someone.</li>
	<li>Lies told for the pleasure of lying.</li>
	<li>Lies told to "please others in smooth discourse."</li>
	<li>Lies that harm no one and that help someone.</li>
	<li>Lies that harm no one and that save someone's life.</li>
	<li>Lies that harm no one and that save someone's "purity."</li>
</blockquote>
</ol>
Svenn Lindskold and Pamela Walters reduce those by 2---though Augustine's previous work is uncited--- in "Categories for the Acceptability of Lies" (1983). Listed from least permissible to most.
<blockquote>

<ol>
	<li>Telling a lie that hurts someone else so that you can gain. In social motivational terms these categories can be said to range from</li>
	<li>Telling a lie that, if successful, could cause others to do something that beneﬁts you while, at the same time, harming themselves or causing themselves a loss.</li>
	<li>Telling a lie to make yourself appear better than you really are or to protect some gain, acquired some time ago, to which you were not really entitled.</li>
	<li>Telling a lie that will inﬂuence others in an ofﬁcial position in such a way that you will gain by their response to you, but they will not be harmed.</li>
	<li>Telling a lie to protect yourself or another from punishment or disapproval for a minor failing or blunder which hurts no one.</li>
	<li>Telling a lie to save others from minor hurt, shame, or embarrassment.</li>
</ol>
