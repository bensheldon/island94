<p>Looks like the FCC has <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080713-no-local-election-coverage-on-tv-no-problem-says-fcc.html">"demonstrate[d], once again, that at present it is difficult, if not impossible to apply public interest pressure to TV stations via the Commission's license renewal process."</a></p>
<p>A Chicago/Milwaukee appeal was made to the FCC over a lack of local and regional political coverage from area broadcasters: less than 1% went to non-federal election coverage in the month prior to the election.</p>
<p>Also interesting how they cut up the types of coverage:</p>
<blockquote><p>
As for the style of the stories, or "frame," as the CMPA study put it, most went to "horse race" stories (guesstimating a candidates' electoral chances at the moment) and "strategic" stories ("how the candidate was using an event to reach particular groups of voters"). Strategy and horse race items dominated coverage. Issues-oriented features counted for less than a fifth of air time.
