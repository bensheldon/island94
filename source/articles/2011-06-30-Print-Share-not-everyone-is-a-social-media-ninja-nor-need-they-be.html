<a href="http://www.island94.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DonorsChoose-Print-and-Share.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2733" title="DonorsChoose Print and Share" src="http://www.island94.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DonorsChoose-Print-and-Share-600x491.png" alt="" width="600" height="491" /></a>

Today is the deadline for DonorsChoose's <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education">Hacking Education Contest</a>, and fortunately I have completed and submittedÂ <a href="http://printandshare.org">Print and Share</a> (with no small effort by <a href="http://b.illbrown.com">Billy</a> on the design). I previously wrote about the <a href="http://www.island94.org/2011/06/data-driven-content-first-design/">details</a>.

Billy wrote my favorite part of the front-page copy: "Not everyone is a social media ninja."

There is also a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWnwdAc2D2k">awkward screencast</a> by yours truly. "This is a great" indeed.
