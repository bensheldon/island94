<p>Interesting article from Ben Goldacre on <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/health/healthmain.html?in_article_id=496612&#038;in_page_id=1774">homeopathy.</a>  In regard to medicine in general, he makes this point:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Prescribing a pill carries its own risks: it medicalises problems, it can promote the idea that a pill is an appropriate response to a social problem such as shyness or difficulties at work.
