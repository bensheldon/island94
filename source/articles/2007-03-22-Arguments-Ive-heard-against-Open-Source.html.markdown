When planning a dynamic website, using <a href="http://nonprofiteye.blogspot.com/2006/11/non-profit-open-source.html">Open Source Software</a> (OSS) can make a lot of sense.  I think there is enough information <a title="technorati search: 'open source is awesome'" href="http://technorati.com/search/open+source+is+awesome">out there</a> about why OSS is the cat's meow, so here are a few reasons I've hear from people that <em>don't</em> want to use Open Source Software for their web development projects:
<ul>
	<li><strong>"I don't know anything about it"</strong> is a common refrain I hear from larger institutions.  This usually translates as "I don't know <em>anyone</em> that does it".  Oftentimes larger organizations will have established relationships---historical, contractual or personal---with proprietary developers.</li>
	<li><strong>"All the examples are really awful"</strong> is a statement  I have to agree with, but fortunately there is an explanation.  Open Source CMS software like <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> is free and relatively easy to use. Thus these systems have an enormous number of people using them; people with no design or development experience.  Therefore there exists a very small signal-to-noise ratio of beautiful and usable websites to poorly designed or out-of-the-box examples.  This means you're much more likely to run across the latter.</li>
	<li><strong>"I hear it's insecure"</strong> is a common and legitimate concern whether you're using open source software, buying a proprietary system, or building from the ground up.  Unfortunately, the explanation for this common refrain is very similar to the aesthetic complaint: because the install base of these systems is so large, there exist many more instances of improper or unsafe configurations or failures to properly update software.</li>
</ul>
