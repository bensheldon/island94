Last week I was contacted through LinkedIn by a stranger asking for help in forming a nonprofit organization. I get these types of requests not infrequently---whether directly through this blog, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bensheldon">LinkedIn</a> or Aardvark---or on mailing lists like Mission Based Massachusetts. My response is usually "Why does your cause necessitate its own 501(c)3? Have you considered <a href="http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/tutorials/fiscal/index.html">Fiscal Sponsorship</a>?"

I subscribe to the belief that when you're working within a formal organization, 50% of your time goes towards maintaining organizational function and only the remainder actually goes towards achieving your external mission. <strong>Bringing a mission to scale may require a formal organization eventually, but if you're trying to </strong><a href="http://authentic.gilbert.org/2006/11/02/why-fail/"><strong>fail faster</strong></a><strong>, is incorporation necessary now?</strong>

The nonprofit sector is already rich with existing organizations and platforms from which you can act. While I don't share in the delusion that it's <a href="http://www.island94.org/2006/10/nonprofit-competition-concept-map/">one big lovefest</a>, there are structures in place to incubate unincorporated projects, give tax-exempt status, and even provide administrative, finance, legal and payroll support. Sure, Fiscal Sponsorship usually carries with it an administration fee (shop around), but even at 20% it could be less than the opportunity cost of you doing all that yourself <em>while</em> trying to achieve your mission.

<strong>So that's how the nonprofit sector lets you do more with less: you don't even need your own nonprofit to participate.</strong>
