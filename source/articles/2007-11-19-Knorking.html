<p>My preferred method for eating has a name--maybe misapplied--but is also culturally debasing: eating with only a fork and using the side to cut/smash-through your food before spearing it.  A survey calls that a "knork", though it is in fact an actual <a href="http://www.knork.net">product</a>.  I'm going to call my method "knorking".</p> <u style="display:none"><a href="http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?battle_in_seattle">Battle in Seattle movie download</a></u>
