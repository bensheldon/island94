This last Sunday, Jessica and I headed over to one of my coworker&#8217;s homes up in Sommerville to nosh on another turkey (squash lasagna for vegetarian Jessica), and all the fixins&#8217; meal.  It was delicious.<!--mapend--><br />

<p>Danielle, the gracious host, had her dad over cooking the Turkey (20 lbs!) in a galvanized trash can.  He&#8217;s a big Boy Scout and tells me he has lots of other tricks up his sleave.  Judging from the moist and flavorful trash-can-turkey, I would go camping with him any day&#8212;or dinner&#8212;of the week.</p>
<p>The photo is a little weird; I was so preoccupied with stuffing my face I didn&#8217;t think until the end, Hey, why not take a picture?.  Everyone was already making their way out the door.</p>
