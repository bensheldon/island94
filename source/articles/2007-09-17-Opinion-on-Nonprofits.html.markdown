<p>Giving the keynote at last weekend's Craigslist Foundation's Nonprofit Bootcamp in New York, was Nancy Lublin, CEO and Chief Old Person of Do Something and founder of Dress for Success.</p>
<p>She gave us her <strong>Top Ten List of things she hates about nonprofits</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being told "Be more like a for-profit". In response: "I wish you would act more like you had the soul of a nonprofit."</li>
<li>The people who say that. In response to the "venture philanthropists": "I'd like you to behave like an ATM with legs.</li>
<li>My grandfather thinks he can find me at home in the middle of the day.</li>
<li>The way you people dress: flannel, cotton turtlenecks, socks with sandals</li>
<li>Redundancy.  There are no market forces to force collaboration: every cosmetic corporation has a breast cancer organization.</li>
<li>Fundraising dinners: it's always salmon.</li>
<li>Used Computers. If it's not good enough for them, why should it be for us?</li>
<li>Direct Mail: antiquated, wastes time, money, trees.</li>
<li>The standard business model: "We do good work.  Give us money".  In response: "Monetize your core competency".  You should hope to put yourself out of business.</li>
<li>Cute names: Do you think you'll raise more money if your name rhymes?</li>
