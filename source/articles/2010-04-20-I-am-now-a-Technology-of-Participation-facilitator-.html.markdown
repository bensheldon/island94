Last week I completed a 2 day <a href="http://www.ica-usa.org/index.php?pr=whatistop">Technology of Participation</a> Facilitator training. Developed by the <a href="http://www.ica-usa.org/index.php">Institute of Cultural Affairs</a>, the Technology of Participation is a series of practices and principles for leading groups through inclusive and participatory dialogues and planning. The training was led by <a href="http://www.gammybird.com/">Nancy Jackson</a> and <a href="http://www.donahue.umassp.edu/services/earlyed/headstart/staff">Ruth-Ann Rasbold</a>, who were excellent.

One of my first questions in the training was the ethical/political dimension to leading participatory methods (after an early morning drive to New Hampshire, I was feeling punchy). Here are the circumstances when participation doesn't work (from the facilitator handbook):
<blockquote>
<div id="_mcePaste">
<ul>
	<li>there is no intention of using the information gathered, the plans made, or the excitement generated when people become involved.</li>
	<li>people are attached to a particular outcome.</li>
	<li>truth telling is not an accepted norm in an organization.</li>
	<li>people are so busy, they are unwilling to set aside the time needed to engage in participatory processes or follow through on their collective decisions.</li>
	<li>there is no apparent need to do things differently</li>
	<li>the leader does not champion participation</li>
	<li>people want a quick ﬁx to a deep problem</li>
	<li>participation is performed around a non-issue or merely a surface issue—that is, when the focus is to "straighten something out."</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><em>from Participation Works: Business Cases from Around the World, James P. Troxel (ed.) with the Institute of Cultural Affairs, Alexandria,<span style="font-style: normal;"><em>Virginia, Miles River Press, 1993, p. 28.</em></span></em></div></blockquote>
I participated in the facilitator training both because of my enjoyment in facilitating small groups---and my desire to improve my methods and confidence for facilitating larger groups---and that my boss is also trained in the Technology of Participation and I've quite enjoyed being a participant in the use of these methods.
