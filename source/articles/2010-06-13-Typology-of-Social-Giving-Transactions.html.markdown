<ul>
	<li><strong>Giving</strong>: a gift. <em>"Please take this dollar. Have a nice day."</em></li>
	<li><strong>Mercy</strong>: a gift to someone of lower social class. <em>"Please take this dollar. But don't buy beer with it."</em></li>
	<li><strong>Charity</strong>: a gift to someone of similar social class. <em>"Here is 50 dollars for your cause. Have you tried the shrimp?"</em></li>
	<li><strong>Donation</strong>: an exchange with the expectation of tax deductability. <em>"Here is 50 dollars. Can I please have a receipt?"</em></li>
	<li><strong>Philanthropy</strong>: a gift of socialÂ magnificence. <em>"Here is 1,000 dollars. Do you have my name spelled correctly for the placque?"</em></li>
</ul>
<em>Note: There types do loosely overlap; charitable donations probably make up the majority of transactions. </em>
