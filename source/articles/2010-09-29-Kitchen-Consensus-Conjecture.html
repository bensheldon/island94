Last weekend I visited Hudson, NY for the [Prometheus Radio Project](http://www.prometheusradio.org/)'s first [full-power radio barnraising](http://www.wgxc.org/). I spent Saturday morning volunteering in the kitchen: despite all of the consensus-process workshops offered at the barnraising, the kitchen ran as an autocracy. Lunch remained delicious.
