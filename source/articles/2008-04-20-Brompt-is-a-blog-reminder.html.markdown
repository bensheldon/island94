<a title="a blog reminder service" href="http://brompt.com"><img src="http://island94.org/files/island94.org/brompt-logo.jpg" alt="Brompt.com logo" /></a>

Two weeks ago I launched a new website at <a title="a blog reminder service" href="http://brompt.com">Brompt.com</a>.  It's a web-based service for unreliable bloggers (like myself) that sends you an email if you haven't posted to your blog in a while.  It's sort've like <a href="http://www.hassleme.co.uk/">HassleMe</a> except Brompt actively scans your blogs RSS feed to only send reminders when you're lax (as opposed to just sending you a reminder every so often).

It's very practical, but I also think Brompt is really interesting conceptually too.  Everyone talks about RSS as just a means to aggregating <em>content</em>, but there is so much other interesting metadata in an RSS feed too.

Right now the site is just the barebones service, but I'm planning on adding some statistics and such so you can track your unreliability.  It's a fun project with a lot of possibilities.
