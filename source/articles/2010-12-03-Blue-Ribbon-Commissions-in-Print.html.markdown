<a href="http://www.island94.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/blue-ribbon-commission.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2343" title="blue ribbon commission" src="http://www.island94.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/blue-ribbon-commission-500x90.png" alt="" width="500" height="90" /></a>

I was annoyed by my <a href="http://www.island94.org/2010/12/proposals-to-change-the-tax-deductibility-of-donations/">previous post</a> quoting the New York Times' usage of "blue ribbon panel" (and the numerous appeals to authority in that entire article) that I looked it up using Google Search's timeline: <em><a href="http://www.google.com/search?tbs=tl:1&amp;q=site:nytimes.com+[%22blue+ribbon+panel%22+OR+%22blue+ribbon+commission%22]">site:nytimes.com ["blue ribbon panel" OR "blue ribbon commission"]</a>.</em> There were 621 results.
