1 cup flour (I've been using white whole wheat)
1 egg
~2tbps cool water

<ol>
<li>Mix flour and egg, adding water until flour is just moistened and sticks together</li>
<li>Let rest for 5 minutes</li>
<li>Knead the dough for 2 minutes.  Or you can do it for 10 minutes; more kneading means better developed gluten and a "smoother" noodle.</li>
<li>Let rest 10 minutes</li>
<li>Roll out or whatever</li>
</ol>
