I go down to New York City to see my friend's new apartment, and somehow get roped into teaching people how to videoblog.  What a crazy weekend.

Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN) hosted a videoblogging meet-and-greet in their studio on Saturday night as part of <a href="http://node101.org">Node101 Weekend</a>.  There were lots of food, people and of course cameras.  Many attendees were cable access producers who had never vlogged before.  I showed them how easy it was to <a href="http://freevlog.org">shoot, edit, compress and upload</a>.  Click on the tableau above, or <a href="http://node101mnn.blip.tv">here</a> to see what people were posting.
