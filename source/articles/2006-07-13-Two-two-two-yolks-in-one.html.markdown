My roommate <a href="http://notthemessiah.net">Dean</a> created this video about some peculiarities in our store bought eggs:

Now I'm not sure what these guy's are doing with their chickens, but frankly the result is a little freaky.  With a name like "Lally Farms," I think anyone would be suspicious.

I made some tacos tonight (eggs, grated carrot and some sliced red pepper on top) and was greeted to the doubly-yolked surprise.  Though honestly, the surprise has worn off since this has been going on for weeks with multiple cartons of eggs.  Now it's just foreboding.

+Update: Checkout <a href="http://www.ranablog.com/archives/000331.php">this blog entry</a> from Notes on an Eclectic Mind about what double yolks may signify.+
