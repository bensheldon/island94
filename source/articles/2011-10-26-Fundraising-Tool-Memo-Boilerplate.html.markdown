Sent this off after some wild, though not misplaced, enthusiasm for Kickstarter, Indiegogo and a few other newish online fundraising services; the soft lead-in and enthusiastic closing paragraph are not included.
<blockquote>No fundraising tool will replace an engaged membership who well-understands the necessity for monetarily supporting the organization's activities. Yes, a certain tool may be marginally more effective for certain kinds of asks or circumstances, but the common framing of tools (especially new/hot online tools) as alternatives to the regular grind of individual giving and relationship development ("cultivation") is a LIE.

When evaluating any tool, the questions to ask is:

1. Why is our existing fundraising strategy/planning insufficient to meet the need for which this tool is the (potential/alleged) solution?

2. Why can't we ask our membership to fund the need directly or through existing channels?

Which is not to take a reactive stance against any adoption of any new tool, but to ensure that we are investing in creating a stable base of individual donors who will fund us regularly and consistently---and building the organizational capacity to ask people for their money honestly, confidently and DIRECTLY.</blockquote>
See also <a href="http://wiki.freegeekchicago.org/wiki/Community/FundingStatement">FreeGeek Chicago's Funding Statement</a>; an excerpt:
<blockquote>We believe these questions should be kept in mind when pursing funding:
<ul>
	<li>How does funding sustain or improve something FreeGeek Chicago already does?</li>
	<li>How does funding make FreeGeek more sustainable?</li>
	<li>Who provides the funding? Do their values and behavior match FreeGeek's mission and values?</li>
	<li>Has FreeGeek planned for the time when funding runs out? Where does it leave us?</li>
	<li>What forms of overhead does the funding create? Do we have the organizational resources to properly manage the transactions?</li>
	<li>What forms of accountability go along with the funding?</li>
	<li>How could the obligations of funding affect our organizational structure and community process?</li>
	<li>Can the goals of a funding source be better filled by another organization (either existing or to be created) outside of FreeGeek?</li>
	<li>Does the funder require personal information from participants? Are we comfortable asking for that information?</li>
</ul>
